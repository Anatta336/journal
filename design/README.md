# Design

This directory and its sub-directories are used to store information about the design of this project.

Development of substantial features should follow this process:

1. Run `init-feature.sh` with the name of the new feature.
2. Store requirements in the `requirements.md` file.
3. Confirm the requirements with the user.
4. Create a plan for what will be implemented in a new `plan.md` markdown file.
